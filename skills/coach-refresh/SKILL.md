# /coach-refresh — rebuild a persona

The user wants **$ARGUMENTS** rebuilt from scratch (their content has moved on, or the
first build was thin). If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty, ask who to refresh.

1. Resolve the personas directories the same way as /coach Step 0
   (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}/personas` primary, `~/.claude/talk-to-anyone/personas`
   legacy fallback) and the person's slug.
2. Wherever `<personas>/<slug>/` exists (check both locations), delete only its
   `persona.md`, `videos.json`, and `transcripts/` contents — that's the re-derivable
   cache for this person.

   **Keep `books/` and `books.json`.** Transcripts and web research re-fetch for free,
   but a book the user supplied from their own copy cannot be re-obtained without
   asking them for the file again. Preserve those entries and re-read them in Step 3.5
   instead of re-extracting. Do drop `books/` entries whose `books.json` `source` is
   `gutenberg` (free to re-pull) if you want genuinely fresh text. If the user
   explicitly asks for a total wipe, say what will be lost and confirm before deleting
   user-supplied books.
3. Run the full `/coach` build for the name: read
   `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/coach/SKILL.md` and follow it from Step 1 (the cache
   check will miss, forcing fresh research and transcript pulls).
4. Finish by adopting the rebuilt persona per /coach Step 6, and note in the handoff
   line that it was rebuilt fresh.
